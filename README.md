# parse-spc
This library is a JS-Library designed to decode SPC (Swiss Payment Codes, also known as QR-Codes, QR-Bills) virtually. The functionality is quite similar to apps like neon or yuh, where you are able to upload a image from your camera roll directly into the application.

This library utilizes the jsQR library as a dependency to decode QR codes and process their data.

## Standardization
This library is based on public documentations provided by SIX Group. It uses the specifications and informations from this document: https://www.six-group.com/dam/download/banking-services/standardization/qr-bill/ig-qr-bill-v2.2-de.pdf

Just for you to know:
- EZE - Endg체ltiger Zahlungsempf채nger (Final receipient)
    - This property is currently not in use by the swiss standard. Therefore it is not useable inside this library.
- ZE - Zahlungsempf채nger (Reciepient)
- EZP - Endg체ltiger Zahlungspflichtiger (The one who needs to pay the bill)
